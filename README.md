# 🧠 Object-Oriented Design

The project follows modular OOP principles:

### 🔹 Ball.java
- Handles ball movement
- Detects wall & paddle collisions
- Updates velocity and position

### 🔹 Paddle.java
- Controls paddle movement
- Handles keyboard input
- Restricts movement within bounds

### 🔹 Score.java
- Tracks player scores
- Renders score display

### 🔹 GamePanel.java
- Contains game loop
- Renders graphics
- Updates game state

### 🔹 GameFrame.java
- Creates main application window

### 🔹 PongGame.java
- Launches the game
